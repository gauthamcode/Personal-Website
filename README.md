# Issue:
-Images glitch out when responsive.
I've got an image aligned to the right and text to the left of the div with a class work_flex. This was done using this block of code:

     .work_flex {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
        align-items: center;
      }
      

I've added a media query that changes the flex-direction: row to flex-direction: column so that on smaller devices I want the text to be center aligned and the image to be bottom aligned. But in my project the images squeeze and stretch awkwardly when viewed in a smaller view port.

You can contact me on my email for any other questions.
